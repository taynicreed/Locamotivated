# Locomotivated

A train web app to help you track your exercise routine. Created using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. 
To use this app you will need MongoDB and node.js. To run, download both folders and open them in your IDE. In the root directory for each folder (starting with exercise-db) run `npm install`, then `npm start` from the terminal. You will have to run each program in its own terminal window. You can access the program in your browser at http://localhost:8000/. 

Locamotivated currently allows users to add, edit, and delete entries. 

Planned updates: 
* add inspirational quotes that are train puns
* host online via Heroku
* password protected accounts

Here's what it looks like now!
